/*
 * osif.h — linux-0.01 port of the Bear Boot Protocol OSIF.

 *
 * Public surface of the linux-0.01 OSIF glue. Only files under bbp/ (the
 * vendored port; canonical source BearBoot/ports/linux01/) may be edited; the
 * BBP core is ABI-frozen. The OSIF wires the OS-independent core to Linus' 1991
 * kernel (linux-0.01-modern: i386, booted by a Limine bootstub that relocates
 * the image to physical 0).
 *
 * THIS IS A NATIVE PORT, NOT A LIMINE ADAPTER. linux-0.01 does not consume
 * Limine response structs; by the time the protocol runs, the kernel is on its
 * own page tables — pg_dir at physical 0 IDENTITY-maps the first 8 MiB
 * (mm/memory.c hardcodes pg_dir = 0). So this port consumes the boot data the
 * 1991 kernel actually knows:
 *
 *   HHDM offset  = 0                        (identity map; virt == phys)
 *   memory map   = config.h HIGH_MEMORY     (the kernel's fixed RAM model)
 *   kernel base  = 0 / 0                     (loaded + linked at physical 0)
 *   ACPI RSDP    = none                      (1991 — predates ACPI)
 *   cmdline      = none                      (1991 — no boot cmdline)
 *
 * Because the map is the identity (HHDM offset 0), the handoff follows
 * SPEC §10.1(a): tag pointers are TRUE physicals that are ALSO valid virtuals,
 * so the parser is seeded with offset 0 (bbp_init), no bbp_init_ex needed.
 *
 * DESIGN — graceful binding (mirrors the tinalinux port):
 *   osif.c stays FREESTANDING (no kernel headers) so it compiles standalone for
 *   `make scaffold-check` and the hosted harness. Its OSIF primitives are
 *   __attribute__((weak)) defaults (COM1 serial / cli;hlt / static arena /
 *   rdtsc). When linked INTO the real linux-0.01 kernel, the glue TU
 *   linux01_bbp.c provides STRONG overrides bound to printk / panic. Same
 *   object, two worlds — chosen at link time, zero #ifdef in core or port.
 *
 * Why the classic BBP dual-alias bug cannot occur here:
 *   The scratch arena is a static buffer, but the kernel is IDENTITY-mapped at
 *   the call site (pg_dir = 0, first 8 MiB), so arena_phys == arena_virt: there
 *   is only one alias. The "kernel-image vs HHDM" arena hazard is structurally
 *   absent — for the simplest possible reason (HHDM offset is literally 0).
