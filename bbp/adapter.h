 *
 * The adapter synthesizes a BBP bbp_info + tag list from the boot data Linus'
 * 1991 kernel actually has — a FIXED RAM model (config.h HIGH_MEMORY, with the
 * 640K-1M hole reserved) and the fact that it is loaded + linked at physical 0
 * and runs identity-mapped — then validates it with the frozen BBP core parser.
 *
 * linux-0.01 is IDENTITY-mapped when this runs (pg_dir = 0 maps the first
 * 8 MiB; mm/memory.c), so this follows SPEC §10.1(a): every tag pointer stored
 * is a TRUE physical that is ALSO a valid virtual (offset 0), and the parser is
 * seeded with HHDM 0 via bbp_init — no bbp_init_ex needed.
 *
 * To stay decoupled from kernel headers (so this file also compiles standalone
 * for `make scaffold-check` and the harness), the caller does NOT pass kernel
 * structs. It fills the neutral `struct bbp_l01_bootinfo` from the kernel's
 * compile-time constants (HIGH_MEMORY etc.) and passes that. One translation
 * point, no hidden ABI coupling.
